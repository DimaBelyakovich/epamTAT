Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect (yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I can work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me
Look at my face, when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never ask no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
